# Aviation Accidents

## Overview
This project analyses the most suitable aircrafts to invest in

## Business Problem
Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

## Data
The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) for this project was extracted from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

## Data Understanding and Cleaning
This project involves a thorough analysis of various aircrafts, focusing on critical risk factors such as safety performance, maintenance costs, operational efficiency, and market viability. By employing data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization techniques.

### Analysis and Visualisations
The purpose for the visualisations were to provide a descriptive analysis and deliver data in a more understanding manner so as to provide insights.These insights will enable the stakeholders to make strategic decisions that minimize risk while maximizing potential returns.
Visualisations are mapped in the attached Jupyter notebook and  for more visualisations on the same, here is a [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/Phase1projectvisualization/Interactivedashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Findings and Conclusions
For a clearer grasp of the findings and conclusions made, here is a [Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGR7uPfdMg/WYNer7fF4-otUGwGTfw7_g/view?utm_content=DAGR7uPfdMg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor) expounding more of the results. Morever, there is a presentation pdf of the same in my repo.
